/**
 * v2 autocrafting planner: an iterative linear backbone plus conflict-directed anytime search over a
 * shared mutable pool, with byproduct reuse and bounded backtracking for contended choices.
 *
 * <p>This is the evolution of the v1 planner (closed-form two-pass, removed). It keeps v1's strengths
 * — quantity-independent batching ({@code ceil} arithmetic), {@code returned} (container/catalyst)
 * inputs in closed form, saturating arithmetic — and adds:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>In-engine cycle breaking ("去头尾")</b>: instead of declining when the recipe graph has a
 *       cycle, a DFS from the target drops back-edges, keeping the recipe direction toward the target
 *       and cutting the reverse. A compress/decompress pair (1 block ⇄ 9 ingots) is planned directly;
 *       the reverse side resolves from stock/missing. Cuts only remove options, so feasibility is never
 *       overstated (no false positives).</li>
 *   <li><b>Shared pool + byproducts</b>: stock and crafting byproducts live in one mutable pool;
 *       demand draws byproducts first, then stock, then crafts. Multi-output patterns are supported
 *       (a pattern's extra outputs feed sibling demands).</li>
 *   <li><b>Dynamic-capacity greedy</b>: among an item's recipes, the one with the highest current
 *       capacity ({@code stock + craftable}) is preferred, so the planner naturally balances onto the
 *       recipe current stock can actually fulfill (no scarcity metric needed).</li>
 *   <li><b>Budgeted backtracking</b>: contended items (more than one recipe) are searched in
 *       capacity order with a {@code trail} for commit/rollback. No node drops candidates at a fixed
 *       route count: a hot node re-ranks every materially distinct route against the current pools and
 *       search continues while the plan-wide deterministic work budget remains. Failed speculative
 *       subtrees are memoized only for the exact node, amount, depth and rollback-restored availability
 *       state, preventing repeated proof work without reusing a stale inventory result.</li>
 *   <li><b>Conflict-directed anytime replay</b>: if a locally successful child route consumes stock
 *       later needed by a sibling, the planner replays the whole request with the implicated choice
 *       changed. The first complete plan is returned immediately; otherwise a graph-scaled
 *       {@code O(E log E)} budget keeps the best concrete partial plan and reports its actionable
 *       missing materials instead of delegating the pathological graph back to AE2.</li>
 *   <li><b>Consumable-bound no-goods</b>: an unavoidable direct raw-consumable shortage is proven
 *       against the exact current pool and quantity, rather than tied to a whole recipe identity.
 *       Thus materially different routes that both require eight unavailable C are pruned alike,
 *       while a route requiring one available C remains eligible.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Soundness (no false positives):</b> the pool is never overdrawn (a draw is capped by what is
 * actually present), so a plan reports {@link CraftPlan#feasible() feasible} only when every demand was
 * met from stock or from a craft whose own inputs were met. Shortfalls always surface in
 * {@link CraftPlan#missing()}.
